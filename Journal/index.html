            <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-02-24">Feb 25 2024</time>
            <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">This article</a> provides some tips for effective game design. The article mentions a concept called dark-UX,where desginers will intentionally put promotional interactive elements in areas on the screen that is easiest to reach so that users are likely to notice them and click on them by either curiosity or by mistake. This is common in a lot of game design because it is proven to maximize revenue. These elements includes: store buttons, more apps, or ads. <br>
            Then for pop-ups, the article suggested to avoid the "X" button because this might suggest this pop-up is something negative that the users will want to close. Instead, replace it with actionable buttons such as "done", or "next step" will give more positive suggections such as the completion of a task. The important thing is to ask the users to take a decision. In terms of user choice in pop-ups, the decision that is good for the game would be placed on the right side, becasue the majority of users are right handed; the decision that is bad for the game is usually on the left side. The article also has tips for other promotional parts of the game that might represent the company in a way, for example in "rate us" dialogues or store dialogues, it is good to have a presentor that is looking at the users; and the action we want the user to do should be a postive color. These parts of the game if done well can be free promotion for the company. </p>

                This picture I took on a trip with my dad to his hometown, it is in a suburbed area in Shandong Province. Corn is a huge export crop for this town, and as shown in the picture it is harvest season again and they are sundrying the corn so that the corn can get preserved for a longer time, or be reprocessed into corn flour. For the every picture project I plan to make a photo albume, I will include a curated collection of pictures I took at different places I've lived at. The project will be a simple timeline of my life with pictures, and it will be an opportunity for me to organize these memories.</p>

                I feel that its really clear from looking at it that its a photography that the creator took at a foreign location. What is the nicest in this picture for me is the green and red color contrast. Additionally I think also the overall scenery communicates a sense of serenity, or a state of mind, I get this impression from the sybolism of the folkish or religious red gate at the middle, and I think that the large amount of water, the mountains and the cypress tree also has symbolism in Asian culture. The whole picture also reminds me of Chihiro a bit. Composition wise, I like how the gate is in the middle as the center object, then the cypress branch frames the whole picture.</p>

            <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">This article</a> talks about how it takes patience and a good amount of attention span for people to understand a piece of material. And pictures are a great medium for getting people to be interested in something, compared to just words.<br>
            Thinking in relations with our upcoming interactive project which relies on pictures, I think this articles gives a guide on how to choose our pictures. We should choose pictures with details, or a story to them, so that viewers can discover these details when looking at the picture; we should choose pictures that prompts open ended questions, people might be confused looking at the pictures and raises questions which they can set out to resolve. Thinking about how might we design these pictures, there should be a theme for all pictures, and it is better if the design foster a sense of community. I found the <a href="https://www.loket.design/">Loket Design</a> website to be doing the above really well. The branding is very clear with harmonious color scheme and graphic design, and each interactive picture prompts the user to want to look at it more in detail.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-02-15">Feb 15 2024</time>
            <p>
            Modals are pop-up windows that grab the user's attention, and it temporarily takes up the whole screen space until the user closes the modal. Modals can have advantages in several ways, such as it saves screen real estate, because it doesn't take up spaces in the actual webpage; and it is a good way to direct the user's attention to some information. Modal windows could be annoying as well, as it interrupts the flow of what the user is trying to do.<br>
            Here are some best practices for designing modals: All of the buttons should be actionable and understandable, there should be a clear action button that direct the user to a next step; there should be an escape hatch, so that users have the option to leave; its beeter practice if the modal is initiated by some action the user makes, such as clicking on a button, this way the modal is more integrated in user flow. Finally modals doesn't match well with mobile, in mobile interface its better to find alternatives such as scroll bar or drop-down menu. This journal is in response to <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">this article</a>.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-02-15">Feb 15 2024</time>
            <p>
            Forms are a vital tool for data collection. UI/UX designers often use it for surveys; business of any fields use forms to gather data; the job application process is also leaning increasingly towards a remote setting. It is important for designers to learn to avoid usability errors and craete forms that are easier to folllow.
            <br><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">The article</a> discusses 20 best practices for form design. Each of these practices are considering the user's workflow, they are compartmentalizing information into steps, priority levels, and necessities. One practice I didn't notice before is the placement of inline texts; it is better to place the labels at the top of the text field, we also need to pay attention to alignment, and margin between the labels and text fields. The text fields it self should give an idication of the amount of text expected from the users. Dropdown menues are not great for forms and it is something we should avoid. The form should have visible priorities, we do this by highlighting certain text bubbles, and by having an action button. 
            <br>When it comes to form design, I think Google Forms examplifies good form design practices. Because users have the option to have different steps, and all the questions are in sensible columns and rows, it also looks obvious when you click on something. Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UNtPjZrQOLGSCc7XFxgpI0ZYvwPJaQ5T1XmutrEfs7U/edit">link</a> to a google form for reference.</p>
